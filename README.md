This is the starter code project for the `Demo 1` project in CMPM 121, Game Development Patterns, at UC Santa Cruz (fall quarter, 2024). Students should incrementally modify this project, tracking their progress with git, to develop an incremental game of their own unique design.

Inspiration Credits:

- https://cheristic.github.io/cmpm-121-demo-1/: Viewing this project and comparing it to my own made my lack of color very clear. It inspired me to decide on a color palette that I maintain throughout the game's UI elements. It also showed me how impactful a background image can be in establishing the setting for your game, and it made me want to put in a background picture of my own.

- https://rozy-dixon.github.io/cmpm-121-demo-1/: The animations of the header text and when the player clicks the coffee button made the game a lot more lively and responsive. It inspired me to implement the scaling effect that happens on the main button when it is clicked, which makes the player feel as though they are swatting a fly. They used CSS keyframe animations, which I had never heard about, so I went to learn more about them. This is what inspired the flying mosquito animation on the main button.
